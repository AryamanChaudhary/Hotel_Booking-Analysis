For example, hotels can offer discounts or promotions to customers who book early or who book for longer stays. Hotels can also offer incentives such as free parking or free breakfast to customers who book directly with them instead of through third-party websites.\n",
        "\n",
        "This EDA involves following steps where in first step involves exploration and inspection over raw data, and second in second step I have dealt with data impurities and cleaned the data by andling null values and dropping irrelevent data from the dataset.\n",

Multivariate analysis: Multivariate analysis is similar to Bivariate analysis but you are comparing more than two variables.\n",
